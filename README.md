# SentimentAnalysisOfVaccinationTweets

This project was inspired to understand the prevailing sentiment with respect to the vaccination rates in the world.

This project used BERT pre-trained model for sentiment analysis

It's sad to know that people still have a negative sentiment with regards to vaccination and governments should motivate their citizens to take up vaccinations and help the world recover
